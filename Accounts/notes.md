<h1>AWS ACCOUNTS</h1>
<h2>Fundamentals</h2>
An AWS Account is a container for <b>Identities</b> (users) and <b>Resources</b>.

- Need <i>unique</i> email address and a payment method.
- Account Root User (has full control over all the AWS Account and any resources created within it & can't be restricted).
- Resources bill to the AWS Account payment method as they are consumed.
- New Identities are created without permissions.
- By <i>default</i> all access to an AWS Account & resources is denied.
> [!TIP]
> AWS can contain the impact of errors/leakage -> Create seperate accounts for seperate things/teams to gain isolation.
